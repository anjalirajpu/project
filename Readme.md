# RentalAgreement Smart Contract

## Vision

The **RentalAgreement** smart contract provides a decentralized solution for managing rental security deposits. This contract ensures transparency and security by allowing tenants to make deposits and landlords to manage refunds or deductions from the deposit based on rental conditions, creating a trustless environment for rental agreements.

## Features

- **Make Security Deposit**:
  - Tenants can securely transfer a deposit to the landlord, which is stored on-chain and recorded for transparency.
- **Manage Deposit**:
  - Landlords can refund or deduct from the deposit based on rental conditions, with the remaining amount available to the tenant.

## Future Scope

1. **Dispute Resolution**:

   - Implement a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism to handle disagreements between tenants and landlords over deposit refunds.

2. **Automated Refunds**:

   - Add automated refund features based on predefined conditions, such as the end of a lease term or inspection results.

3. **Multi-Tenant Support**:
   - Enable multi-tenant rental agreements, where deposits are handled for multiple tenants in a single property.

The **RentalAgreement** contract offers a secure and transparent way to manage rental deposits, ensuring both tenants and landlords are protected in a decentralized rental environment.
